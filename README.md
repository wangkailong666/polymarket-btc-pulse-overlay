# BTC Pulse Overlay

Fast market context. Zero trade calls.

BTC Pulse Overlay is a read-only browser extension that adds a live Binance spot reference panel directly into compatible Polymarket price pages. It surfaces price, latency, short-term flow, and liquidity in the place people already look, without placing orders, clicking buttons, or telling anyone what to trade.

If your first question on a compatible market page is "what is spot doing right now?", this extension answers it immediately.

- Lightweight liquidity context from depth, spread, and recent flow

## What it does not do

- Place trades
- Click buttons
- Automate the site
- Emit entry or exit instructions

## Compatible pages

The current version is tuned for Polymarket price markets where the price header row is visible on the page.

Currently verified assets:

- BTC
- ETH
- SOL
- XRP
- DOGE

Unsupported 5-minute assets show an unavailable label instead of falling back to BTC.

## Design guardrails

This project should remain:
